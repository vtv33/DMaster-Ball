If you are bored with the COVID-19 season but want to find a game to entertain, here we introduce you to a game called DMaster Ball.

This is a very simple 3D  game created with Unity. The game itself is not refined, yet it contains all the "ingredients" needed to learn the paradigms underlying videogames development including (but not limited to) player-obstacles interaction, physics, GUI, sounds,  etc. With the simplicity of this game, it simply aims to bring fun and make you look back to your childhood’s ball control games with some new modern features.

Unity version Unity 2020.3.10f1
